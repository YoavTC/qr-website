    <p>
        I wanted to try and make a flute mod in Minecraft for a long time before actual development started, I donâ€™t remember why or when but I knew I wanted to add another level of peacefulness to my Minecraft base.
    </p>
    <p>
        I live in a Meadow, which is one of the most calming and peaceful biomes in Minecraft due it its blue water and not so saturated green grass, and its tendency to generate near tall mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
        So one day, I was having my morning cup of tea (which I also want to add into the game) whilst sitting playing Minecraft on my PC. I was observing the view from my base, and thought to myself that the perfect addition to add to this vibe would be flute sounds. Something out of a kung-fu-panda movie, or Avatar the last airbender's outro theme.
    </p>
    <p>
        Quickly after I started coding the item into the game, I ran into an issue of not knowing how to control the notes on the flute. Most instruments are too complicated to be directly implemented into video games, so game developers find ways around the lack of fingers 
    </p>
    <p>
        The best example that I could find is the way Guitar Hero's strings turned into buttons on a custom controller or keyboard keys, with each button representing a string, and the timings of the keys being pressed is what determined the score. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Seeing that there were no famous games with controllables implementations of flutes, I decided to try to make something new. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I took the player's pitch (angle of where they look up & down), and put it into a function that plays the correct note based on said pitch
        I also decided not to modify one sound with many pitches, because it sounded awful, and instead recorded multiple sounds with my mother's flute.
    </p>
    <p>
        After finishing up some final touches, I published the mod on <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/bamboo-flute" target="_blank">CurseForge</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        The mod was also featured on TheDerpyWhale's <a href="https://youtu.be/3-sAjXnRzR4?t=180" target="_blank">youtube video.</a>
