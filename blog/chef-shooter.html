        Chef Shooter is my firsst completed project in Unity, I made it from my already existing knowledge of C#, and some YouTube tutorials.
    </p>
    <p>
        The game is a simple 2D wave-shooter, where you play as a chef that needs to protect his kitchen from incoming rats.
        <br>
        The rats vary in size and speed, and the more you kill the faster they spawn and thus it gets more and more difficult.
    </p>
    <p>
        The game was made using the <a href="https://unity.com/" target="_blank">Unity</a> game engine, design was made with <a href="https://www.aseprite.org/" target="_blank">Aseprite</a> and <a href="https://www.adobe.com/il_en/products/photoshop.html" target="_blank">Photoshop</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        I made the visual art for the game, while a friend of mine <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@noamkuchy4098" target="_blank">Kuchy</a> made the soundtrack.
