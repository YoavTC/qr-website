    <p>
        At the time I decided to open my own Minecraft server, I had a semi large local TikTok following, so when I did open my SMP to the public, overnight the discord was floded with more than 500 members.
    </p>
    <p>
        The server was a vanilla+ survivle server, using utility plugins such as a simple home teleportion system, teleporting to friends and some basic claims to avoide griefing.
        <br>
        After around two months since the server became public, I decided to take it more seriously, recruiting two of my best friends at the time to be my right hand men, and help me moderate the players on the server.
    </p>
    <p>
        We decided to reset the world, and start with a fresh new 'season'
        of CLAYTYNE (The name of the server). Over the following year and a half, I would create and manage 6 seasons of the server, each one consisting of around 2 months, and then a reset.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each season would come with a brand new spawn (A safe space for the players to trade, chat and hang out), new NPCs that give out quests and sell or buy items from the players for the server's currency.
        <br>
        The start of a new season encouraged the players to try new ways of playing the game with different people. Many life long friendships formed in my server, and that is one of my biggest achivments.
    </p>
    <p>
        I closed the server after around 1 year and a half to focus more on my social life and school education, because I was struggling with mental health, and that had made it more difficult for me to do well in school.
        <br>
        The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@claytyneserver3182" target="_blank">YouTube</a> page of the server still exists to this day and remains as an archive of the server's history.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Some statistics about the server:</h2>
    <p>
        The server has a very rich history, of over 350 players that have played for more than a season. Over 1000 unique players overall, 2000 memebers in the Discord server.
    </p>
    <p>
        Although the server was an Israeli server, and the members communicated in Hebrew, we had members from all around the world, from Norway and the United Kingdome.
    </p>
    <p>
        Paying for a server was an expensive not so fun task I had to do, but shortly after upgrading the hosting service, I ran out of money, so I considered closing the server, some members said that they would pay for a rank and suggested me to add ranks into the game. I didn't want to violate the EULA and ruin the game for the non paying players, so all I gave ranks were some extra commands (which could not give them an advantage, only make their lifes easier) and cool cosmetic items. I have had a varity of ranks, and I managed to keep the server up with a small profit of 200â‚ª each season.
