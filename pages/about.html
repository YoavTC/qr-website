        More About Me
    </h1>
    <p>
        My passion for creating experiences that I and others could enjoy started at a very young age. I made a board game with my mother about gnomes stealing gems from a hut. My mom made the art and the pieces because she's an artist, and I was a literal child. <br><br>I don't really remember the rules of the game, but I remember enjoying playing it with her and, when it was finished, playing with friends. 
        <br><br><br><br> 
        I was never a good student. I was a troublemaker, hated listening to teachers, and participated in stupid group activities.I spent most of my time at school daydreaming and coming up with new ideas.
        <br><br> 
        Of course, I also hated doing homework, so I played video games instead. The first game I ever played was 'Mogobe'. A social club penguin-like kind of game where you have to collect dragon pets, raise them, and decorate your house. The game also had an in-game currency, and you could get more money by playing mini-games found in certain places.
        <br><br>
        Although I almost never play those games, my dream game is to create an MMO RPG that has a limited world to explore but tons of quests and combat with other players or NPCs.
        <br><br>
        I got pretty close to it when I created my <a href="../projects/minecraft-server.html">Minecraft Server</a> utilizing the already existing game mechanics and easy addon support.

    <h3>A bit on how I started creating games:</h3>
    <p>
        I started learning how to code when I was 13 years old using Skript language for my Minecraft server,

        and at that time, my high school introduced a new computer science class in C#, which I was happy to join.<br><br>
        Unfortunately, I had to drop out because I was in the middle of transferring to a new school, 
        but, using the knowledge I gained, I started developing games in Unity, and created my first-ever game, <a href="https://yoav-tc.itch.io/chef-shooter" target="_blank">Chef Shooter</a>. <br><br>

        While I enjoyed coding the game, I wanted to bring my passion for Minecraft into my projects,
        so, I began modding Minecraft using the Fabric Library. <br> <br>
        Soon I began to create some mods that I felt fit the style of the vanilla game,
        you can check out all of my projects on the <a href="projects.html">Projects</a> page of my website.

    <h3>About me now (13/05/2023):</h3>
    <p>
        Now I mostly work on existing projects that I develop alone, or create new ones.<br> The most recent game I made is called <a href="contact.html">Pizza Defender</a>, and its on the Play Store.

        <br><br>
        I am planning to take a trip to Europe soon, and I hope to get inspired by new and exciting ideas.
