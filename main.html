        <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
            Hello, my name is Yoav, I go by "yoav_tc" online,
            <br>
            most of my free time, I like to play video games, code and create or imagine new experiences
            for me, my friends and others.
            <br>
            <br>
            I am a 18 year old, I live in Tel-Aviv in Israel, I love to explore and discover
            new cultures by eating food, visiting places and learning some new words in random languages.
            <br>
            I also love to test my knowledge of programming, I first started learning
            how to code at the age of 13 using the <a href="https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript/releases" target="_blank">Skript</a> language
            <br>
            for my Minecraft server.
            <br>
            <br>
            Around the same time my highschool started a new computer science class in C# so of course I joined.
            <br>
            <br>
            Unfortantly, I couldnt keep going to that class because I was in the middle of a process of switching schools,
            <br>
            So using the knoewledge I had learnt from that class (and some YouTube tutorials), I decided to try and code my very first game
            (<a href="https://yoav-tc.itch.io/chef-shooter" target="_blank">Chef Shooter</a>)
            <br><br>
            Altough I loved making that game, I wanted to apply my passion for Minecraft to my projects, so I started modding Minecraft using the <a href="https://fabricmc.net/" target="_blank">Fabric library</a>.
            <br>
            <br>
            Since then, I have created a bunch of Minecraft mods, and a couple of video games using the <a href="https://unity.com/" target="_blank">UnityEngine</a> and Java (no game engine)
            <br>
            <br>
            You can see all of my projects listed in the <a href="projects.     html" target="_blank">projects page</a> of my website
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            And by the way, this is my little sister Ginger:
