    <p>
        Hello, my name is Yoav, most of the time I go by "yoav_tc" online,
        <br>
        most of my free time, I like to play video games, code, create or imagine new experiences
        for me, my friends and others.
        <br>
        <br>
        I am a 18 year old, I live in Tel-Aviv in Israel, I love to explore and discover
        new cultures by eating food and visiting places.
        <br>
        I also love to test my knowledge of computing, I first started learning
        how to code at the age of 13 using the <a href="https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript/releases" target="_blank">Skript</a> language
        <br>
        for my Minecraft server.
        <br>
        <br>
        Around the same time, my highschool started a new computer science class in C# so of course I joined.
        <br>
        <br>
        Unfortantly, I couldnt keep going to that class because I was in the middle of a process of switching schools,
        <br>
        So using the knoewledge I had learnt from that class, I decided to try and code my very first game
        (<a href="https://yoav-tc.itch.io/chef-shooter" target="_blank">Chef Shooter</a>)
        <br><br>
        I loved it but I wanted to apply my passion for Minecraft to my projects, so I started modding Minecraft using the Fabric Library.
        <br>
        <br>
        You can see all of my projects listed in the <a href="projects.html" target="_blank">projects page</a> of my website
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        And by the way, this is my little sister Ginger:
